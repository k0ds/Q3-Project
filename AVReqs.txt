Explanation of what the absolute value function's input and output represent
Labels of the following key features:
Vertex, including whether it is a minimum or maximum
x-intercepts/zeros/roots
y-intercept
domain
range
Explanation of what the key features represent in the context of the function
Explanation of how each of the key features of the intercepts and vertex can be found algebraically
What transformations would be applied to the parent function, 
, in order to obtain the function
How these transformations can be identified algebraically
